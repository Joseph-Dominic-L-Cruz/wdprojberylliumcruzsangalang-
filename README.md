   1. Title: **Chessmate** 

   2) Website Description

   Chessmate is a chess-themed website containing interactive content on the board game. It aims to enable users to learn more about chess, practice their skills in it through a virtual game, and thus develop their creativity, problem-solving skills, and critical thinking through it. Its homepage, which gives basic information on chess and its benefits and features an introduction to the functions and core objectives of the website, can lead users to two main webpages. In the first webpage, people who are new to the board game can access tutorials and lessons about it through many forms of multimedia. They can learn the dynamics of chess, its history, various chess openings, and techniques in the game through articles, images, videos, interactive slides, and chess puzzles. In the second main page, users can practice their skills through a playable chess board. The player will be able to play against another opponent with time controls using the same chess board and will allow them to flip the board with every move. It will also have the ability to record and process chess notation. We plan for the web page to also have a chess engine. Chessmate aims to not only to further promote the competitive game of chess online but also enhance its users’ ability to strategize, think quickly and logically, and efficiently solve problems.

   4. Description of Javascript Application

   Chessmate will apply Javascript in all its web pages containing the website’s main content. In the first webpage, which contains the information about chess, Javascript will manipulate the interactive slideshows containing the articles for the various topics in chess. As the user goes through the contents of the slideshow by clicking the “next” and “previous” buttons, Javascript will manipulate the classes and display properties of each individual slide, thus affecting how the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) program will act on the code. If the CSS will only display a slide with a specific class or ID and a user clicks on the next button, Javascript will be able to change the class or ID of the next slide to the desired class or ID and the other slides to other classes or IDs, so the CSS will display only the desired slide on the screen. 

   More importantly, Javascript will also be responsible for carrying out the processes and storing the information needed in the playability of the chessboard. It should be able to detect illegal moves and moves such as pins, checks, capturing, castling, promotion, and en passant, along with detecting checkmates, stalemates, and draws by repetition. It will also be responsible for storing the information of the chessboard itself in arrays or objects, including the locations of any and all chess pieces still on the board, along with castling rights, promotion, and pins. It should also contain an algorithm to record and process chess notation. It will also contain a database of the chess puzzles in the first content page, along with the corresponding correct moves to be played in these puzzles and an algorithm, which uses if-else or switch-case statements, to detect whether the player made the right move. 

   Javascript will also be responsible for the algorithm for the multiplayer using the same computer. It will be able to detect whose move it is, whether white or black, prevent the other side from being able to move, and flip the board depending on whose turn it is. It will also contain the algorithm for custom time control with time increments, having presets such as rapid (10 minutes), blitz (5 minutes), and bullet (1 minute), and it will also allow the player to adjust the time differently for each player. For example, one player will have a time control of 5|5, meaning 5 minutes and 5 second increments, whilst the other has a time control of 10 minutes.

   And as stated earlier, Javascript would also contain the algorithm for the chess engine. We plan to research and study chess engine algorithms such as Minimax and alpha-beta pruning, along with other techniques to increase the strength of the chess engine in terms of playstyle. We hope to understand and implement these algorithms on our website.
